## Student Marksheet and Number Comparison Programs

This repository contains five C programs developed by Rudra Thakkar on 23-06-2025. The programs are designed to perform various tasks, including calculating a student's average marks, determining the maximum and minimum numbers from four inputs using different comparison operators.

### Programs Overview

1. **Student Marksheet**
   - This program takes a student's name, roll number, and marks for three subjects as input. It calculates the average marks and determines if the student has passed or failed based on the marks obtained. It also assigns a grade based on the average marks.

   **Input:**
   - Name
   - Roll Number
   - Marks for Subject 1
   - Marks for Subject 2
   - Marks for Subject 3

   **Output:**
   - Marksheet displaying the roll number, name, marks, average marks, and grade.

2. **Maximum Number (Using Greater Than Operator)**
   - This program takes four numbers as input and determines the maximum number using the greater than operator.

   **Input:**
   - Four numbers

   **Output:**
   - The maximum number among the four inputs.

3. **Maximum Number (Using Less Than Operator)**
   - This program takes four numbers as input and determines the maximum number using the less than operator.

   **Input:**
   - Four numbers

   **Output:**
   - The maximum number among the four inputs.

4. **Minimum Number (Using Less Than Operator)**
   - This program takes four numbers as input and determines the minimum number using the less than operator.

   **Input:**
   - Four numbers

   **Output:**
   - The minimum number among the four inputs.

5. **Minimum Number (Using Greater Than Operator)**
   - This program takes four numbers as input and determines the minimum number using the greater than operator.

   **Input:**
   - Four numbers

   **Output:**
   - The minimum number among the four inputs.
